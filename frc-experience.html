        <h2>2025 - Mako</h2>
        <p> After Spending my 2025 On season with Breaker Bots, I moved to Maryland, and joined team 2377, C-Company. While I was not part of the build season for this robot, I will be working on minor upgrades and code improvements, and helping out in multiple offseason events.
